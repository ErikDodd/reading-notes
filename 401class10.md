## Stacks and Queue

- Q. What is a Stack? 
- A. Stack: A data structure made up of nodes. It has a top. It follows the FILO and LIFO principles. It is similiar conceptually to a linked list but different.

- Q. What does push() do?
- A. Push() will add a node or item to a stack

- Q. What does pop() do?
- A. Pop() will remove a node or item from a stack

- Q. What does peek() do?
- A. Peek() allows you to view the value of the top Node.

- Q. What does FILO and LIFO mean?
- A. First In Last Out and Last In First Out. For FILO, the first item added to a stack will be the last item popped out of the stack. For LIFO, the last item added to a stack will be the first item popped out of the stack

- Q. What type of operation is push()?
- A. 0(1) - it will always take the same amount of time regardless of the number of nodes in the stack

- Q. What is a Queue?
- A. Stack: A data structure made up of nodes. It has a front and a rear. It deals with the FIFO and LILO principles.

- Q. What does dequeue() do?
- A. It removes a node or item from the front of the Queue

- Q. What does enqueue() do?
- It adds a node or item to the back of the Queue

- Q. What type of operation is enqueue()?
- A. 0(1) - it will always take the same amount of time regardless of the number of nodes in the stack
