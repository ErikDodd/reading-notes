# Code 201 - Class 10 - Reading Notes

## Debugging

**1.Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**

- Syntax errors are spelling errors in your code that cause the code to stop working, while logic errors are areas where the syntax is correct but the logic doesn't work. With logic errors the code works but doesn't produce the results you intended.  There isn't an error message when this happens, while with Syntax errors do produce a message and help you find the source of the error more easily.

**2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**

- I had a syntax error where the value produced was null. In order to fix it, we example the line where the issue was and noticed that it was selecting a variable that wasn't defined.

**3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**

- This topic gave me a good framework for how to debug. It gives me the process of locating the error, evaluating that specific line of code to see if everything was spelled correctly and making sure I didn't leave out a semi-colon or parentheses. Then from there make the adjustment. This will be helpful because I want to get better at debugging and improve my root cause resolution skills.

**4. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**

- The Javascript Debugger tool is in the browser that allows you to look at your code and evaluate each value of variable and set up breakpoints to help you determine where the code stopped working.

**5. Define what a breakpoint is.**

- A breakpoint allows you to isolate points of your code to determine what is working and what isn't working. You can set breakpoints to pause execution at a certain place in your code to see if it works or does not work.

**6. What is the call stack?**

- The call stack shows you what code was executed in order to get the current line.
