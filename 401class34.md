## Django Settings Best Practices

- It is normal to have several different environments like local, dev, ci, qa, staging, and production and each of those environments has different settings
- Each Django project comes with a SECRET_KEY which is where DB passwords and API tokens for Third Party's
- Django settings are literally python code which can have some advantages but also has some tricky aspects about it
- A popular option for managing different environments for a team is using settings_local.py
- Another option is to have separate settings for each environment, to do this you make a settings package with features like base.py, ci.py, local.py, staging.py, production.py, qa.py
- Another option that considers this problem with sensitive data is utilizing the environment variables in Django
- 12 Factors: A collection of recommendation for recommendations for building a distributed web app
- 12 Factors recommends that the collection has the following parts: Codebase, Dependencies, Config, Backing services, Build/release/run, processes, Port binding, Concurrency, Disposability, Dev/prod parity, Logs, and Admin Processes
- One of the main rules for 12 Factors is to store configuration in the environment
- Tips for naming conventions: give meaningful names to your settings, always use the prefix with the project name for your custom (project) settings, and add descriptions for your settings in the comments
- Some Django Settings Best Practices: keep settings in environment variables, write default values for a production configuration, split settings into the groups of Django/third-party/project, follow the naming conventions for custom settings
