# Code 201 - Class 5 - Reading Notes

## Learn Javascript - Objects

**1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?**

- Is a set of data of functionality that is related. For instance, it could be a bunch of information that describes a person, their age, their height, and other items that describe them. They are made up of properties such as age, height, etc.

**2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?**

- It is a more efficient way to send a single object literal and to use less code. There is more flexibility when declaring. There is also a high level of convenience in using object literals.

**3. How do objects differ from arrays?**

- Objects contain properties which are related. This has several properties which you can declare. An array stores lists of data but only in a single variable. Objects can have multiple variables.

**4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.**

- If you are using an object's name at run time.

**5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?**

This refers to the current object that the code is written inside of. For the code below, this refers to 'dog'. The advantage in using 'this' is that you can use it when creating mutiple objects like if you had 3 different 'dog' objects.

## Introduction to the DOM

**1. What is the DOM?**

- It stands for Document Object Model and is a data representation that contains the structure and the contents of that object.

**2.Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.**

- Javascript can be used by the DOM to access the webpage and all of its elements. It is not a programming language but DOM allows you to manipulate all the elements of the page using Javacscript.
