# Code 201 - Class 3 - Reading Notes

## Learn HTML

**1.When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?**

- When the numerical ordering of the list isn't necessary. When you can change around the order of the list and the meaning isn't changed.

**2.How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?**

- Using the 'list-style-type' property in CSS.

**3.When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?**

- Ordered list is used when you the order of the list is meaningful or important like in a recipe or directions. You use an unorder list if the order isn't important, for instance, if you are listing countries you've travelled.

**4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?**

- Use the 'type' attribute nestled inside the 'ol' element in. HTML. Or use the 'start' attribute nestled inside the 'ol' element in HTML.

## Learn CSS

**1.Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?**

- If content is the main character in a story, then margin is a background character and padding is the supporting character. Padding is close to the content, whereas margin is in the same scenes or story but really just in the background not getting any attention.

**2.List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.**

Content - is whatever you are text, image, or visible piece of information you are sharing.
Padding - is the area directly around the content. It's white space.
Border - This wraps all the way around the padding and the content.
Margin - is the outer most layer. It's also white space as well.

## Learn Javascript

**1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?**

- String, numbers, Boolean, Objects

**2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?**

- Yes it is a valid array. You can access the values by using console.log(people)

**3.List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.**

- Assignment - assigns value to something x=f ( )
- Addition Assignment - adds value to the right of the operand and assigns the result to the variable
- Subtraction Assignment - subtracts value to the right of the operand and assigns the result to the variable
- Mutiplication Assignment - mutiplies value to the right of the operand and assigns the result to the variable
- Division Assignment - divides value to the right of the operand and assigns the result to the variable

**4.Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.**

- Result would be 10. Not sure why it is 10 but I ran it in replit.com and that's what I got.

**5.Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.**
