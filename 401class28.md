# Code 401 - Class 28 - Reading Notes

## Django Forms:

- HTML Form: A group of fields found on a web page that is used for gathering information from the user.- Forms are used to deal with user input and validation
- Forms can accept many types of data such as text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.
- Django Forms are supposedly more simple and easy to use
- Type attribute determines what type of widget will be displayed
- Name & ID attributes are used for identification purposes for Javascript/CSS/HTML
- Label tag lets you know what to input into the form field
- Form attribute will tell you what type of HTTP method is being used to send the data to the server
- Method tells you whether it is a post or get request
- Post method should be used if the data is going to result in something changing in the servers database. While the Get method is used when forms don't change what is happening with a user's data.
- forms.CharField and forms.IntegerField are two examples of field classes that define different types of fields in the forms
- {{ form. as_p }} or {{form.as_table}} are easy/quick ways to render a form in a template
- The appearance of a form can be customized by using Bootstrap classes and custom CSS.
- ModelForm is used to create and update models in the database by way of using forms
- forms.ChoiceField and 'forms.MultipleChoiceField' are ways to either create dropdown menus or multiple choice fields in your form.
- forms.DateField and forms.DateTimeField create date and datetime fields in your form
