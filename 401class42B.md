## The Code I'm Still Ashamed Of:

- This is an interesting question about what you should do when you are asked to write code or create a website that has potentially harmful consequences. Or perhaps has a level of moral ambiguity to it or maybe it's just downright wrong. I agree that it is important to consider the consequences of the code we wrote and what type of potential it has to impact people. But the challenge is when it happened to the author, in this instance, he just did what he was told/paid to do. No shame to him. But I think that's the challenge right there. People can lose sight of their moral compass or rationalize why they did something really easily.

## Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence:

- Technology and Big Data have huge potentially negative implications for society and democracy in particular. The author talks about all the ways in which new AI and Big Data-driven technology can impact society. Deepfake videos, propaganda, tech companies having access to so much information they can potentially manipulate human behavior, and much more. I think what is interesting about this topic is that this AI / Machine learning technology is so new it's hard to always see or consider the negative ways these types of tools can be used for. The author also talks about how AI and Big Data can be used for good to protect democracy which I think is the best way to address these concerns. I think the article does a good job to recommend things like data privacy, transparency, and accountability/other ethical considerations to help combat this.
