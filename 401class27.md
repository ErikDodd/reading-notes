## Using Models

- Models are how a Django Web application is able to both access/manage data
- Models are like blueprints that define the structure of the data that is stored.
- Models can contain field types, default values, selection list options, label text for forms, and more
- Once you write the model, Django will communicate with the database for you
- Consider using separate models for each object (group of information that is related) ex. books, book instances, and authors.
- Django lets you have one-to-one (OneToOneField), one-to-many (ForeignKey) and many-to-many (ManyToManyField) relationships
- Where do you define models? The applications models.py file
- Fields: Models can have any number of fields and one field represents one column of data we store in a database table
- Examples of Common Field Arguments: help_text, verbose_name, default, null, blank, choices, primary_key
- Examples of Common Field Types: CharField, TextField, IntegerField, DateField/DateTimeField, EmailField, FileField, ImageField, AutoField,
- Models can have methods. At minimum, every model should include the class method __str__()
- Once the model has been defined, you can use them to do CRUD-type actions on records

## Django Admin

- Django Admin allows you to use your model to automatically build a site area where you can create, view, update, and delete records.
- This allows you to test models and see if you have the right data or not 
- In order to register your model, go to admin.py and add the following admin.site.register() and pass in the name of your model. 
- Be sure to import the model at the top of the page too
- In order to access the admin site and view/create records, we need to create a 'superuser' that has full access to the website
- to create a superuser use the following code in the terminal: python3 manage.py createsuperuser
- Once you log into the admin portion of the website as as superuser, you can add, edit, and view records

## Things I'd Like to Know More About

- I'd like to know some other examples of using models to build web applications. For instance, they talked about books, authors, and other models
- What are some ways that using models can be helpful when developing with Django?
