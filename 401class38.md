# Code 401 - Class 38 - Reading Notes

## React Conditional Rendering

- Conditional rendering React is essentially the same as how it works in Javascript
- It can use JS operators like if or conditional operator to create a current state
- Variables can be used to store elements
- JSX Expressions can be embedded by wrapping curly braces around the expression
- You can use Inline If-else conditional operator to render elements inline
- The syntax is condition ? true : false
- If you want a component to hide itself return null


## React Lists and Keys

- Collections of elements can be built with curly braces and JSX can be included 
- A "key" is required when creating a list of elements.
- This is a unique key that is a special string attribute for each element in the list
- Keys let react know which items have been altered or changed
- It is not recommended to use indexes for keys especially if the order of the items could potentially change
- Keys need to be different for each sibling 


## React - Lifting State Up

- In react, we share state by passing it to closest common ancestor component that requires state
- We do this using this.props ex. this.props.temperature
- Needs to be a single "source of truth" for any data that changes in a React app
- If something can be either props or state, chances are that it's props and not state


## React Composition vs. Inheritance

- They do not recommend creating component inheritance hierarchies for React apps
- Components can accept arbitrary props, primitive values, React elements and functions

## React Thinking in React

- React is one of the best ways for building a big, fast web app using Javascript- Utilize single responsibility principle when considering whether or not to componetize something
- If a component grows, then break it down into smaller subcomponents as you go
- Reminder, props are a way to pass data from a parent to a child component
- Build the static version of the app first before building the interactive one
- DRY is an important factor for making your UI Interactive
