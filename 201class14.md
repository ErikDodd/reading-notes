## CSS Transforms

**1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?**

- CSS transforms allows you to adjust elements on either a 2D or 3D plane. It allows you to do things like rotate an element, scale an element, translate an element, skew an element and more.

**2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.**

- You could use CSS transform to scale an element like a photo to adjust the size of it to make it bigger or smaller.

## CSS Transition and Animations

**1. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?**

- CSS transition allows you to adjust the appearance and behavior of an element when a state change like hovering over the element occurs. Different styles can be set for different states using CSS transition.

**2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**

- CSS animation deals with multiple state changes using the keyframes rule, whereas CSS animation only focuses on one state.

## More CSS Transition

**1. What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?**

- Creates a more engaging website and increases user engagement.

**2. How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?**

- CSS transitions will help me design better applications and websites. Using things like 'fade in' or 'grow' you can make your application or website more interactive and easier to use. It gives me a nice item for the metaphorical toolbelt to create a better more engaging experience for the user.
