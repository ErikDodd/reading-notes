# Class 4 Reading Notes - HTML

## ***What is a HTML***

A **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language) - is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. It is the foundation of a website or the skeleton, metaphorically speaking.

### Some Important things to remember about **HTML**

1. HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content
2. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way
3. The format of an HTML element contains opening tags, content, and closing tags.
4. Elements can have attributes.

### Other important terms related to HTML

1. **The opening tag**: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
2. **The closing tag**: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a  closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
3. **The content**: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
4. **Nesting Elements** - Elements can be placed inside other elements.

### Every HTML Document Must Include

- <!DOCTYPE html> — doctype.
-  <html></html> — the <html> element.
- <head></head> — the <head>
- <meta charset="utf-8"> — This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages.
- <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"> — This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider then the viewport and then shrinking them down.
- <title></title> — the <title> element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.
<body></body> — the <body> element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
