# Code 401 - Class 18 - Reading Notes

## Encryption, Decryption & Hacking

- Encryption: Scrambling a message according to a secret key
- Decryption: recovering the original message/data using the secret key
- Code Cracking: Uncovering the original data without access to the secret key.
- Caesar Cipher was one of the earliest known instances of encryption techniques being used.
- Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher that replaces a letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting a specific amount of times
- 3 Methods for cracking the encryption without the key: frequency analysis, known plaintext, and brute force
- Frequency Analysis: Analyze the frequency of characters in a message and identify the most likely E and narrow down the shifts based on that
- Known Plaintext: If you know some portion of the plaintext, it is easier to crack the rest of the encryption. Ex. WWII Germans  used Weather forecast at the start of the message every time

## Crpytography

- Defense in depth: many levels of varying security measures to frustrate attackers
- Cryptography literally means "secret writing"
- Famous example of Cryptography is German Enigma Machine used by the Nazi in WWII and eventually cracked by Alan Turing
- The German Enigma Machine was a type of substitution cipher but it was very complex for it's time
- Data Encryption Standard: one of the first software ciphers to be widely used/implemented
- Advanced Encryption Standard was published in 2001
- AES is now used everywhere like for file encryption on Iphones, sending data over the internet, to accessing websites, etc

## Things I want to know more about

- I'd like to learn about other ways cryptography is used for security and cybersecurity in modern times
- I'd like to learn more about some of common types of ciphers used
- I'm interested in other historical examples of cryptography being used.
