## Beginner's Guide to Docker

- One of the biggest advantages of Docker is that the whole development environment is isolated
- Docker allows you t to bypass the virtual environment and locally reproduce a production environment with certain specifications
- One of the downsides of Docker is its complexity. There is a lot going on under the hood
- Docker is based on Linux Containers
- Before docker, virtualization and virtual machines allowed multiple programmers to use the same machine.
- Docker is essentially an easy way to implement Linux containers
- Virtual environments can isolate a Python software package locally but that is all they can do. Docker is more expansive, it can run a production database and other things in its environment
- Once docker is installed check to see if it is the most current version, at least version 19. Run the command 'docker --version' in the terminal
- Proof of life to see if docker is installed correctly, is to run "docker run hello-world" in the terminal which will download the official image and then run the container
- docker info command will show you the number of containers, whether it is running, or paused, or stopped, and the number of images
- Dockerfile contains the instructions that you use to create an image
- docker-compose.yml is what you use to control how a container will be run
- touch Dockerfile creates the Dockerfile we will use
- touch docker-compose.yml is the file that has the container instruction
- Image: It is a picture of what the project contains
- Container: This is a running instance of the image
- docker-compse.yml file is what runs the container
- docker image build . is the command you run in the terminal to build an image
- docker image ls shows all the existing docker images, this allows you to confirm that image was built
- Images are made up of one more image layers
- Dockerfiles run from the top to the bottom, so order does matter

## Django for APIs - Chapter 3: Library Website

- Django REST Framework works in conjunction with the DJango web framework and this is how to create web APIs
- It is important to add the Django REST Framework to the project once everything has been installed and configured
- A big difference between Django and the Django REST framework is that Django creates websites while Django REST Frameworks creates web APIs which have a collection of URL endpoints containing available HTTP verbs and te return is in JSON format
- Models.py: The section where you define the database model you will be using
- views.py: Deals with how the database model content will be displayed in browser. Where the request/response logic for the web app lives
- Django doesn't come with a built-in urls.py for your app when built, so you need to create it

## What I want to Know More About 

- Honestly can't think of anything at the moment. Just super excited to dive in and do more work with Django REST Frameworks.
