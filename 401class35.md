## Graph Quiz

Graph Quiz:

Q. What is a graph?
A. A non-linear data structure that contains a collections of nodes(aka vertices) that are connected by edges(lines).

Q. What is a vertex?
A. It is a node.

Q. What is an edge?
A. The line/connection between two nodes

Q. What is a Neighbor?
A. Nodes that are connected by an edge

Q. What is an undirected graph?
A. A graph that doesn't move/point in a specific direction.

Q. What is a directed graph?
A. The opposite of an undirected graph. It is a graph where every edge is directed. This type of graph has a direction, where each node is directed towards another node.

Q. What are 3 types of graphs?
A. Complete, Connected, Disconnected

Q. What is a complete graph?
A. A graph where each node is connected to every other node

Q. What is a Connected graph?
A. A graph where each node has at least one edge

Q. What is a disconnected graph?
A. A graph where some vertices may not have edges

Q. What is the difference between Acyclic vs Cyclic?
A.An Acyclic graph is a directed graph that doesn't have cycles while a Cyclic graph is not directed and has cycles

Q. What are two ways we represent graphs?
A. Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List

Q. What is a weighted graph?
A. A graph with numbers assigned to its edges

Q. What types of traversals can be used on a graph?
A. Breadth First and Depth First

Q. What are some real-world examples of graphs?
A. GPS/Mapping, Driving Directions, Social Networks, Airline Traffic, Netflix suggested products
