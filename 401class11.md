# Code 401 - Class 11 - Reading Notes

## What is JupyterLab?

- Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals and custom components in a flexible and integrated manner.
- Allows you to work seamlessly with data and code together side by side
- Multiple documents can be organized and arranged in the work area and the area can be divided and organized according to your preference.
- Contains Code consoles that allow you to run code interactively- Markdown, Python, R, LaTex can be used in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Many file formats like images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-lite can be used.
- All standard images are all supported in Jupyter Notebooks and as files
- Can view HTML as well
- Command mode is designed for navigating and changing framework for the notebook
- A = add a cell below, B = add a cell below, C = Copy, V = Paste, X = Cut, Z = Undo
- Tons of shortcuts and other than the ones listed above


## NumPy

- Numpy: Commonly used data analysis Library. 
- Allows you to speed up work flow, interface with different packages in Python, and more
- Arise as a byproduct of an older package named Numeric
- SSV: Semi-colon Separated Values - a way to store data where each record is separated by a semi-colon and rows are separated by a new line
- NumPy works with multidimensional arrays, including 2-D arrays which are called Matrix- Conceptualize a matrix as a list of lists
- Rank: number of dimensions in a NumPy array
- Axis: Each dimension in a NumPy 
- array-numpy.array() : Will create a NumPy Array
- Use float elements for the array since it is better for computation
- Shape property of NumPy arrays will give you the total number of rows and columns for the data
