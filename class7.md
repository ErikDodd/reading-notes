# Class 7 Reading Notes - Programming in JavaScript

## ***More info on Javascript***

**control flow** - is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

- order = 1st line down to the last line in the file
- Unless comp runs across structures like conditionals and loops which change the control flow
- Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

Ex. function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}

**Javascript Function** - a block of code which is created to complete a specific task.
This is executed when “something” invokes it.

- Format = keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses
- Can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables
- The code to be executed, by the function, is located inside of the curly brackets

**Function invocation** - This occurs when the code located inside the function will execute when “something” calls the function

- Event occurs = user is clicking a button
- Invoked (called) By Javascript Code
- Automatically (self invoked)

**Function return** - function will stop executing when the JS reaches a return statement.

- Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.

- **Local variables** - declared within the Javascript function. These variables can only be accessed from within the function’

**Assignment Operator** - The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.

**Addition Operator** - The addition operator (+) adds numbers.

**Mutiplication Operator** - The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.

**Addition Assignment** - operator (+=) adds a value to a variable.
