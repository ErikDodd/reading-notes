## Trees

- Q. What is the root of a tree?
- A. Root: The node located at the beginning of a tree
- Q. What is K in a tree?
- A. A number that relates to the max amount of children any node can have in the k-ary tree.
- Q. What is the edge in a tree?
- A. It is the link between a parent and child node?
- Q. What is a leaf in a tree?
- A. A node without any parent or child nodes
- Q. What is the height in a tree?
- A. The number of edges in a tree starting from the root and extending to the further test
- Q. Describe Depth First as it relates to trees?
- A. A way to traverse trees where we start by focusing on the height of the tree. We can traverse by pre-order, in-order, or post-order
- Q. For breadth-first traversal, does it typically use a stack or a queue?
- A. What is the difference between a Binary Tree and a K-ary Tree?
- A. Binary trees have only two child nodes but K-ary trees can have more than two child nodes
- Q. What is a binary search tree?
- A. A tree that doesn't have any structure and all nodes are organized by their size. Nodes smaller than the root are placed to the left and nodes that are greater than the root are placed to the right
- Q. What is the best way to a Binary Search Tree?
- A. While loop
