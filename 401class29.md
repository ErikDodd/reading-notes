# Code 401 - Class 29 - Reading Notes

## Django Custom User Model

- Django comes with a standard built-in user model which deals with authentication.
- Documentation recommends that you always use a custom user model instead
- One super important note, after you do the initial steps of installing django, making a new project, making a new app, and starting the server, do not migrate
- You first need to create your new customer user model before doing the migration. Super important
- Custom User Models can be created by using either AbstractUser or AbstractBaseUser
- AbstractUser is better. AbstractBaseUser requires a more work/heavy lifting.
- Four steps for creating a custom user model are update settings.py, create new CustomUser model, create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm, and update admin
- Once custom user model has been set up, you can always go back and add additional fields
- Django for Beginners by Will Vincent is also worth a purchase

## DjangoX

- DjangoX utilizes Django 4.1 & Pyton 3.10
- Need to install Pip, Pipenv or Docker
- You can install DjangoX with Pip, Pipenv, or Docker
- DjangoX is free to use by cloning Will Vincent's DjangoX repo

## Abstract User, User Profile and Signals in Django

- UserModel that comes standard with Django has email, username, password, storage quota, and picture
- You can add extra fields to a user model
-  Doing a custom user model from a new project is easy. You need to add 'class User(AbstractUser)
- Also need to add 'settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL in the settings.py file
- Those two steps are important so add them first when you do a new Django Project or at the start 
- Good order is do the new project, Add User Class, and then migrate
- Once you make changes to your model, remember to do the migrations
