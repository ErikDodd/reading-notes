**Expression** - is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. 2 types of expressions:

 1. Contain side effects (like assigning value)
 2. Purely evaluate

JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator.

**Binary operator** = operand1 operator operand2

**Unary Operator** - operator operand or operand operator

**Assignment Operator** - assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.
x = f()

**A for loop** - repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. 

- for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement

  **The do...while statement** - repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

  - do

while (condition);

**A while statement**  executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
