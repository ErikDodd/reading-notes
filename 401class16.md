## What is Serverless Computing?

- Serverless: Cloud computing application that allows you to build/run an application without having to manage servers or any backend infrastructure
- An advantage to serverless is that you don't pay for idle capacity
- Surprisingly, serverless does not mean that there are no servers involved. Rather serverless refers to the developer not having to deal with/manage/interact with them
- Serverless platforms are provided by AWS (AWS Lambda), Microsoft Azure (Azure Functions), Google Cloud ( Google Cloud Functions) and IBM Cloud (IBM Cloud Code Engine)
- Cloud-native application development consists of serverless computing, microservices, and containers as core items
- FaaS: (Funcation-as-a-Service) is a cloud computing service that allows devs to run code for specific requests without having to manage the backend infrastructure.
- Advantages of Serverless computing: Provisioning time, Administrative Burden, Maintenance, Scaling, Capacity Planning, Statelessness, High Availability/Disaster recovery, Resource utilization, and billing granularity and savings.
- Kubernetes: an open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, management, and scaling of containers
- Serverless apps are typically deployed in containers
- Knative: Open source extension for Kubernetes that provides it with the serverless framework
- Pros of Serverless: Improved developer productivity, pay for execution only, develop in any language, streamlined development/DevOps cycles, cost-effective performance, usage visibility
