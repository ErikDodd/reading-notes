# Code 401 - Class 19 - Reading Notes

## Python Regular Expression Tutorial:

- RegEx: Regular Expression is a sequence of characters that checks to see if a pattern exists in a string or not. 
- Used to validate email addresses or passwords, parse text data, and more.
- Good for manipulating textual data
- Step one, import re at the top of the page. This is the Python library that supports regex
- Match() - if an object matches a pattern this will return a matched object. If not, it returns None
- ^: Matches the start of a string. Used if you want to check if a document/sentence begins with specific characters
- $: Matches the end of the string. Used for checking if a document or sentence will end with a specific character
- [a-zA-Z0-9] - Matches any letter from a to or A to Z or 0 to 9
- \w - Matches any single letter digit, or underscore
-\W - Matches any character not part of the \w
- \s matches single whitespace like space, newline, tab returns
- \S - Matches any character not part of \s
- Compile() - Changes a regex pattern into a regex object. Typically regex is a string in python
- Search() - lets you examine a string or sequence and looks for the first location where the regex produces a match
- FindAll() - Finds all the matches that fits the regex pattern and returns them in a list of strings
- split() - Looks for a matching string and splits the string at the point where it matches 
- start() - Returns the starting index of the match
- end() - Returns the index where a match ends
- Span() - Returns a tuple containing both the start and end locations of a match


## Things I want to know more about

- What are some other practical uses of regex? Besides email validation and ensuring passwords meet a certain criteria
- What are some cool ways to encorporate RegEx into projects?
- Are there any other cool regex related resources like regex101.com that I should be aware.
