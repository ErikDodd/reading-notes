# Code 301 - Class 7 - Reading Notes

## REST

**1. Who is Roy Fielding?**

- He helped write the first web servers that sent documents across the internet. He helped create HTTP.

**2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

- Every programming language, database, or system has a different way of talking to each other. We need to use a URL so that all machines can talk to each other in the same way.

**3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

- Fielding created REST. Different nouns (image, URL, etc) can be used with verbs (GET, POST, Delete) to do things on the web page that help render a page.

**4. What does a GET do?**

- GET uses the HTTP Protocol to retrieve images, text, video, etc, and render them on the page.

**5. What does a POST do?**

- POST uses the HTTP Protocol to send data to the API server to create or update a resource.

**6. What does PUT do?**

- PUT uses the HTTP Protocol to modify a singular resource that is already a part of a resources collection.

**7. What does PATCH do?**

- PATCH uses the HTTP Protocol and applies partial modifications to a resource
