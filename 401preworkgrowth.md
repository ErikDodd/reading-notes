# Code 401 - Pre-work - Growth Mindset

## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice

This topic is important because it gives you the groundwork for how to focus on becoming a better programmer. Focus on building CRUD apps frequently. Get outside of your comfort zone and challenge yourself with software development projects that are difficult. Frequency is important. Make sure that you are practicing with consistency. Also, make sure the practice is highly demanding from a mental standpoint.

Deliberate practice is the key concept. It is summarized as "Activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individualâ€™s performance."

## Carol Dweck on Growth Mindset

The topic is important because it deals with the concept of a growth mindset and how your abilities can be developed over time. For learning software development having a growth mindset is absolutely critical. We learn topics that are new to us and intellectually difficult in a fast pace environment. You have to embrace the philosophy of 'not yet' instead of living in the fear of now. Growth mindset can help you focus on curiosity and engaging with a challenge head on, instead of avoiding it. This topic is important because doing a software development BootCamp is not a cake walk, and it requires a lot of faith, persistence, and belief in yourself. Growth mindset can be the thing that helps you power through in the face of difficulty and uncertainty.

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

This topic is important because the concept of grit is critical to being successful in any topic or area of study. Grit is a very egalitarian concept because it doesn't have to do IQ or anything like that. Grit is important for our purposes because we are in an environment that requires lots of time, effort, and sacrifice to be successful. One doesn't achieve this without a high level of grit. I think grit is a hugely important aspect of doing anything well. Ms. Duckworth brings up an interesting idea of how do we increase grit? The answer is related to growth mindset. Belief in growth mindset can help increase grit. I see both areas as linked and they both tie into the idea and belief that through effort and determination, one can achieve amazing things.

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

This topic is important because it has do with the idea of changing our views on success. It has do with the idea of burdens of being professional successfully, having nice material things, etc. It has do with the pressures that come with meritocracy and wanting to be successful and some of the pitfalls or unintended consequences associated with it. The topic discusses failure and the judgement and ridicule associated with failure.
