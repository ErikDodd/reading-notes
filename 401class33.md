## JSON Web Tokens

- JSON Web Token(JWT): A way to securely transmit info between parties as JSON Objects 
- JWT are analogous to having a stamp to get back into a nightclub
- JWT is used most commonly for Authorization, once a user logs in, they get a JWT token and this gives them access without having to re-sign in
- JWT is also used for information exchange, it allows you to safely send information to a verified individual
- JWT consists of a Header, Payload, and Signature
- Header contains the type of token that is used (JWT Token) and the signing algorithm that is used
- Payload contains claims which can be registered, public or private claims
- Import to not store sensitive session info in the browser like SSN or Credit Card info due to the lack of security
- Signed tokens expose all the information they contain and are viewable to other parties, so don't add secret info here.
- JSON parsers are common in most programming languages

## DRF JWT Authentication

- JWT works with frontend web frameworks like React, Angular or VueJS
- JWT is authorization tokens that should be included in all requests
- Once you sign in with a username and password, you receive an access token and a refresh token, so when you refresh the page you don't have to sign in again
- Access tokens typically expire in 5 minutes but refresh tokens expire in 24 hours
- Format for a JWT token is header.payload.signature
- to Install a simplejwt in the terminal run, pip install djangorestframework_simplejwt

## Django Runserver is Not Your Production Server

- Development servers are great for development but they should not be used as a part of your production setup
- The main reason is that it has not gone through either security audits or performance-based tests, so slower and less safe
- Production stack includes a web server (example is Nginx) and application server (example is Gunicorn)
- Each Django project has a uwsgi.py file that has a function that gets the incoming request in the form of a Python object
- This function works by calling your code which creates a response object which is then passed to the WSGI server. The response is then translated into an HTTP response and sent back to the web server which then delivers it to the user

## Things I Want To Know More About
- What are some other options that developers use other than Gunicorn?
- What some other uses for JSON Web Tokens not listed in the articles?
