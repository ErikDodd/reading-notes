# Class 5 Reading Notes - CSS

## ***What is a CSS***

A **Cascading Style Sheets** (CSS) - provides style and helps you present how a website looks to its users. 

### Some Important things to remember about **CSS**:

1. It is a rule-based language.
2. CSS overrides the browserâ€™s default style and allows you to customize the website to give it a specific look and feel.
3. You can target specific elements, tags, or groups on your page.
4. CSS is what makes a website appealing and interesting.

### Other important terms related to CSS:

- **Selector** - chooses which HTML element you will style
- **Property** - Color or Font size
- **Value** - what you would like to do to the property (change font size or color)

### There are 3 ways to insert CSS:

1. **External CSS** - Using one external style sheet, you can alter an entire website by only editing one file. You must be sure to link the element to HTML page and also save you stylesheet with the **.css** extension.
2. **Internal CSS** - Used if one single HTML page has a different, unique style than the others. This can be done using the style element located inside the head section.
3. **Inline CSS** - Used to apply style for a single element. In this instance, the style attribute is included in the specific element you would like to style.

### All styles in page cascade into a new virtual style sheet using the following priority:

1. Inline Style (inside an HTML element)
2. External and Internal Style sheets (in the head section)
3. Browser default

**Inline style** has the highest priority and will override the others
