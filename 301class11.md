## nosql vs sql

**1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

- NoSQL = non-relational database or distributed database, document based database/key value pairs/graph database/wide column stores, dynamic schema for unstructured data, horizontally scalable, queries focused on a collection of documents, MongoDB/BigTable/Redis/RavenDb/Cassandra, not good for complex queries
- SQL = Relational Database, table database, predefined schema, vertically scalable, uses Structured Query Language, examples MySql/Oracle/Sqlite/Postgres/MS-SQL, good for complex query intensive environment

**2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

-  The type of data where you can store data in a large table

**3. Give a real world example.**

- If you were storing raw sales data in the form of a table

**4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

- Documents or graph-based data

**5. Give a real world example.**

- Data in the form of a graph showing sales data and how it changes month-over-month

**6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

- NoSQL

**7. Which type of database is best for scalability?**

- SQL

## More sql vs. nosql

**1. What does SQL stand for?**

- Structured Query Language

**2. What is a relational database?**

- A database that supports SQL. It is a structured database that recognizes relations among stored items of info. This works with related tables.

**3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

- It is filled with multiple related tables that contain fields(columns) and records (rows).

**4. What is a ‘schema’?**

- Refers to which data can go into a table. The different fields that need to be filled in.

**5. What is a NoSQL database?**

- MongoDB

**6. How does it work?**

- Uses collections with documents insteads of tables. Doesn't use the same schema as SQL.

**7. What is inside of a Mongo database?**

**8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

**9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**
