# Code 401 - Class 41 - Reading Notes

## Dynamic Routes:

- Next.js allows you statically generate pages with paths that use external data
- Create a page called [id].js in pages/posts
- Pages that start and end with brackets are used for dynamic routes for Next.js
- Export getStaticPaths which is an async function that returns a list of potential values to be used for the id
- Implement getStaticProps which is used to fetch necessary data
- Inside lib/posts.js add getAllPostIds function at the bottom of the page which will return a list of file names for the posts one the directory
- Import getAllPostIds function and use this inside of the getStaticPaths function
- To render markdown content, use the remark library which can be installed with npm install remark remark-html

## Deployment:

- Vercel platform was developed by the creators of Next.js so it is the easiest way to deploy
- Vercel is a serverless platform used for both static/hybrid applications
- DPS stands for Develop, Preview and Ship and it is a helpful workflow to utilize
- Develop: Write your code in Next.js and use the development server to see how everything renders/looks
- Preview: Utilize the Vercel preview deployment 
- Ship: Merge pull request back to main before shipping the code to production
- Next.js can be deployed to other hosting providers that also support Node.js, but Vercel is just the best option
