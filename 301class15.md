# Code 301 - Class 15 - Reading Notes

## What is OAuth?

**1. What is OAuth?**

- It is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how servers and service can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without sharing the same initial login credential.

**2. Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.**

- When you visit a website and it allows you the chance to login using another website's log in like Gmail.

**3. How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?**

- The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user using AuthO, which provides the user's verified identity. The second site generates a one-time token and one-time unique secret to the transaction and parties involved in the request. The first site gives the token/secret to the user's client software. The client's software presents the request token and secret to the authorization provider. The client may be asked to authenticate, then after the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website. The user approves the transaction at the first website. The user is give an an approved access token and they use this token at the first website. The first website gives the access token to the second website to prove the user is authenticated and the second website lets the first website access the site for the users. The users see a successfuly completed transaction occurring.

**4. What is OpenID?**

- Is for authentication instead of authorization. OpenID is for humans logging into machines, OAuth is for machines logging into machines on behalf of humans.

## Authorization and Authentication flows

**1. What is the difference between authorization and authentication?**

- Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service and authorization determines their access rights.

**2. What is Authorization Code Flow?**

- It allows a client application to obtain authorized access to protected resources like web APIs.

**3. What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?**

- It is an OpenId Connect flow specifically designed to authenticate native or mobile apps for users.

**4. What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?**

- It uses OIDC to implement web-sign in The web app requests and obtains tokens through the front channel without the need for secrets or extra backend calls.

**5. What is Client Credentials Flow?**

- It is a server-to-server flow. There is no user authentication involved.

**6. What is Device Authorization Flow?**

- It is an extension to the original OAuth 2.0 that solves the problem of obtaining access tokens on devices where the user has limited possibilities to enter it's credentials (app on a TV).

**7. What is Resource Owner Password Flow?**

- Allows for exchanging the user name and password of the user for an access token.
