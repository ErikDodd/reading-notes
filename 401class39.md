# Code 401 - Class 39 - Reading Notes

## Next JS

- Next.js is a React Framework that comes with excellent built-in features like a page-based routing system, pre-rendering, automatic code splitting which helps the page load faster, client-side routing, built-in CSS/Sass support, and more
- Need to have Node.js installed, version 10.13 or later
- To create a next.js app, run a command similar to this in the terminal:  npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-blog --use-npm --example
- Use npm run dev to start the development server 
- The next.js development server has a Fast Refresh mode which helps make changes to the browser almost immediately without refreshing

## React Context 
- Context helps you share state in your applications
- When does it make sense to use React context? Basically whenever you need data to be accessible in any component
- React context is kind of like the equivalent of global variables for React components
- Context helps prevent props drilling which is when you pass down props multiple levels to a nested component when some components don't actually need it
- With React context, we can actually by using props in general and just give the data we need to whatever component needs it
- To use context, we need to import React from 'react'
- Use createContext method to create context
- Another way to use context is through the useContext hook. Instead of using props, you just pass the entire context object to React.useContext()
- Sometimes you don't need to use context, rather you can organize your components better to avoid using context or prop drilling

## Why I'm Using Next.js in 2020

- Next.js is a framework built on top of react and removes some of the complexity but still allows you to build scalable apps
- Next.js has a Fast Refresh feature that allows React state to be preserved 
- Debugging in Next.js is nice and easy to use
