## How To Run Linear Regression in Python:

- Scikit-Learn: A python package that deals with machine learning, data analysis, linear regression, etc.
- Liner Regression: Finding the straight line that best fits scattered data points. This will also predict new data points as well 
- Coefficient: AKA Parameter - the factor the variable will be multipled by.
- Coeefificnetof Determination: the correlation coefficient denoted as R2.
- Correlation - The relationship between two variables. Value ranges between -1 and 1
- Intercept: The location where slope meets the Y-axis. It's the "b" in the y= ax+b 
- Residual: Distance between a point of data and the linear regression line. 
- Regression - Estimate of predictive change in a variable in relation to changes in other variables
- Slope: Deals with the steepness of linear regression

## Linear Regression in Python

- Linear regression is super important for machine learning.
- Linear regression deals with statistics, machine learning, and scientific computing
- Regression looks for relationship between variables.
- Dependent features are called dependent variables, outputs or responses
- Independent features are called independent variables, inputs, regressors, or predictors
- Mutiple Linear Regression referees to linear regression with two or more independent variables
- Underfitting: When a model can't accurately capture the dependencies among the data, usually due to the simplicity of the model. 
- Overfitting: When a model learns both data dependencies and random fluctuations. AKA when it models the existing data too well.
- NumPy is used for Linear Regression in Python. It's a python scientific package that does work on single or multi-dimensional arrays. Lots of other math formulas and math stuff too.
