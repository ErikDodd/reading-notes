## Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

**1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?**

- Local storage is the process of storing something locally on your computer or on solid-state drives or other external storage devices instead like thumb drives. You would use local storage because the web is stateless, meaning that when you close an application the state will be reset the next time you open it. If you do this on your local computer and re-open it, it returns to it's most recent state.

**2. What information should not be stored in local storage?**

- Passwords or personal information. Sensitive data.

**3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?**

- It only stores strings in different keys, so storing them locally they won't be stored in the way you would want them to. You would use  jSon.stringify and JSON.parse to work around this.
