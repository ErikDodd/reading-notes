## What is **Growth Mindset**?

**Growth Mindset** is the idea that anything can be learned or achieved with increased **_practice, training, and method_**. It's the idea that your brain is like a muscle and that muscle can be increased. It's the opposite of fixed mindset which states that the intelligence you have is fixed and can't be changed. It's critical to learning a new skill where you will face many challenges and obstacles. 

Growth Mindset means: 

- believing in yourself 
- trying new things, 
- making mistakes 
- experiencing set backs but persisting  

Through this process you will increase your intelligence, confidence, and self-belief. Anything is possible with a Growth Mindset!

>I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can't accept not trying. - _Michael Jordan_

3 reminders for **Growth Mindset**:

1. You may not know now, but you'll know it soon
2. Push the "I believe!" button
3. Ask for help - work with colleagues, ask your Professor/Manager, don't be shy
