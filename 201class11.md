## Video and Audio Content

**1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.**

- Videos on the web were initially done through plugin based technologies like Flash and Silverlight. They have since been replaced by the Native HTML solutions of the video and audio tag which allow you a greater amount of control when building in videos and audios to your website.

**2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.**

- Src is used for videos in a similar manner to the way it is used for pictures. It contains the link to the source of the video you want to embed. The controls attribute allows you to include the browser's own interface that allows you to control both the video and audio playback.

**3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?** 

- This is important if the browser that is accessing the page doesn't support the video element. It will display content so you can add a link to the video that way the user has access to view it regardless of what type of browser they are using.

## A Complete Guide to the Grid

** 1.How does Grid layout differ from Flex?**

- CSS grid is a 2-dimensionalÂ layout system that allows you to more easily design user interfaces. In the past, we used Flex as a way to do this but it's one-directional flow works really well in some instances but grid allows you to more easily layout the UI.

**2. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?**

- This is important because nowadays people view websites on screens of all different sizes like phones and tablets. You want the images responsive so you can better control the look and feel of the website regardless of what size screen the user is using.

**2. Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.**

- srcset allows us to define a certain set of images the browser will use and choose from and it also sets the what size each image will be. We set the sizes using 'sizes' which defines a set of media containers that will be used depending on the size of the screen viewing the content.
