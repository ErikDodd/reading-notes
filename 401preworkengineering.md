# Code 401 - Pre-work - Engineering Reading

## Discussion Questions

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

- I have a unique blend of high EQ, problem-solving, and leadership skills. This allows me to get along with essentially anyone and build relationships with great ease.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- Debug, Google the question, W3Schools, ask a classmate for help, try rubber duck method

## How to Think Like A Programmer

- Steps for problem-solving: Understand, Plan, Divide.
- Understanding the problem is critical and it is important to make sure you know what is being asked.- Can you explain the problem in plain English? This is a good test of how well you understand something/
- Write down the problem, drawing a diagram or the rubber duck method are all very helpful for understanding a problem.
- “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”
- Use comments as a tool for planning your solution
- Break problems into sub-problems and then solve the easier sub-problems and try to connect the dots to get a solution.

## Solving Problems

- Poor time management is a common problem for programmers when struggling with interviews
- Resist the urge to write code too soon, make sure you understand the problem first
- Framework for Problem-Solving listed below

1. Read the problem completely twice.

2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.

3. Optimize the manual steps.

4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

6. Optimize the real code.

## The 5 Whys

- "The method is remarkably simple: when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times."
- Best used to solve simple or moderately difficult problems
- 7 Step process of the 5 Whys:

1. Assemble a Team

2. Define the Problem

3. Ask the first "Why"

4. Ask Why 4 more Times

5. Know When to Stop

6. Address the Root Causes
