# Code 401 - Class 36 - Reading Notes

## Whiteboarding Tips

- Communication is key. Demonstrate your ability to communicate as a team member, as someone solving problems, as a person, etc
- It is important to restate the question. This will never be a bad idea, it will either confirm your suspicions or point out if you misunderstood something
- Ask About Edge Cases. This shows you are analytical and thinking about potential bugs ahead of time
- Ask about Test Cases. They will either give you an example or think it's brilliant you are considering testing already
- Start by writing pseudo-code to check your logic and write the actual code later.
- Make sure to ask the interviewer if the pseudo-code looks good or makes sense. They may not give you any information but they may point out potential flaws in logic
- It's smart to ask for help if you are stuck. Phraseit like "Can you nudge me in the right direction?"

## 7 Tips to Ace A Programming Interview:

- Take a few minutes to collect your thoughts. Thinking and talking is hard, so it's a good idea to take some time just to think and then discuss after
- Write down the steps of the solution, to give you an overall game plan or strategy for how to approach this problem and solve it
- Write the pseudo-code first, don't focus on the syntax just come up with the general structure and then you can focus on the syntax later
- Don't worry about the small stuff, if you make a mistake, brush it off and move on
- Sit down and be humble, the interview is more than just a technical problem, it shows how you communicate, your interpersonalÂ skills, how you deal with criticism, etc.
- Come prepared. PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE- Review your work.

## Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed

- Companies get it wrong when they focus too much on whether or not the candidate got the problem correct
- Be more concerned with how they deconstruct the problem and then how they move through the problem
- Facebook(Meta) does a reasonably good job at their coding interviews. They also have interviewer training at Facebook too
- Get really comfortable with the basics. Focus on Data Structures
- Don't spend like 6 months prepping for interviews, just like a couple weeks.

## Things I'd Like to Know More About

- Are there are good resources to use to prep for interviews? Outside of HackerRank, LeetCode, etc.
- What are some good general tips for what to do when you get stuck in a super challenging technical interview question?
