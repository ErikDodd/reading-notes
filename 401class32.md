# Code 401 - Class 32 - Reading Notes

## DRF Permissions

- Permissions decide whether a request can be granted or denied access
- Permissions are used for determining whether a certain type of user can access different parts of the API
- One of the simplest forms of this is allowing access to an authenticated user and denying access to any unauthenticated users
- When permission checks fail you will see a "403 Forbidden" or a "401 unauthorized" response
- REST Framework permissions allow support object-level permissions which determine whether a user can act on a particular object, for example, a model instance
- You can DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES in the REST_FRAMEWORK variable to set permissions globally. You can either add IsAuthenticated to allow authenticated users or AllowAny to allow any type of user
- AllowAny permission class gives unrestricted access regardless of whether or not the request is authenticated
- IsAuthenticated permission classes only grants access to authenticated users. This is a good option if you want the API to be accessible to individual users who are registered
- IsAdminUser permission class denies access to any user unless user.is_staff is True
- IsAuthetnicatedOrReadOnly permission class gives access to authenticated users to perform any type of request like a GET, HEAD, or Options requests
- DjangoModelPermissions grants access if the user is authenticated and they have been assigned relevant model permissions
- Custom permissions can be implemented by overriding BasePermission and using the .has_permission(self,request,view) or .has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj)
