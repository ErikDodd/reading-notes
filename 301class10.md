# Code 301 - Class 9 - Reading Notes

## Javascript Call Stack

**1. What is a ‘call’?**

- It is essentially invoking a function. The call stack deals with how the order functions are executed and they are done one at a time (from top to bottom) since it is synchronous.

**2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?**

- One at a time, from top to bottom.

**3. What does LIFO mean?**

- Last In, First Out.

**4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.**

- function firstFunction(){  throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');}
function secondFunction(){  firstFunction();}
function thirdFunction(){  secondFunction();}
thirdFunction();

**5. What causes a Stack Overflow?**

- This occurs when there is a function that calls(recursive function) itself that doesn't have an exit point. The browser has a maximum stack call limit that it can reach before it produces a stack error.

## Javascript Error Messages

**1. What is a ‘reference error’?**

- When you use a variable that hasn't been declared yet.

**2. What is a ‘syntax error’?**

- When something cannot be parsed due to an issue with syntax.

**3. What is a ‘range error’?**

- When you try to pass a value as an argument to a function that does not allow range that includes that value.

**4. What is a ‘type error’?**

- When the type you are trying to use/access is incompatible.

**5. What is a breakpoint?**

- an intentional stopping point in a program which is used for debugging.

**6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?**

- It creates a breakpoint
